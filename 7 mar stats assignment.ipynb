    "\n",
    "# A measure of central tendency (also referred to as measures of centre or central location) is a summary measure that attempts to describe a whole set of data with a single value that represents the middle or centre of its distribution.\n",
    "# There are three main measures of central tendency:\n",
    "# mode\n",
    "# median\n",
    "# mean\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mode\n",
    "# The mode is the most commonly occurring value in a distribution.\n",

    "# 54 is mode here\n",
    "\n",
    "# Median\n",
    "# The median is the middle value in distribution when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "# The median divides the distribution in half (there are 50% of observations on either side of the median value). In a distribution with an odd number of observations, the median value is the middle value.  \n",
    "# Looking at the retirement age distribution (which has 11 observations), the median is the middle value, which is 57 years:  \n",
    "# 54, 54, 54, 55, 56, 57, 57, 58, 58, 60, 60 \n",
    "# When the distribution has an even number of observations, the median value is the mean of the two middle values.  In the following distribution, the two middle values are 56 and 57, therefore the median equals 56.5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mean\n",
    "# The mean is the sum of the value of each observation in a dataset divided by the number of observations. This is also known as the arithmetic average. \n",
    "# Looking at the retirement age distribution again: \n",
    "# 54, 54, 54, 55, 56, 57, 57, 58, 58, 60, 60\n",
    "# The mean is calculated by adding together all the values (54+54+54+55+56+57+57+58+58+60+60 = 623) and dividing by the number of observations (11) which equals 56.6 years."
